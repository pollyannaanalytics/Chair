## Description
This is Pin-Yun's project at AppWorks School -- Chair, an Android application born out of a background in social work and sociology. I believe that true friendship is about connecting with people who truly understand your concerns and struggles. With this in mind, I have developed an innovative solution that leverages OpenAI's capabilities to help users find like-minded individuals who share their challenges. FriendConnect offers video chat functionality to facilitate these meaningful connections.
