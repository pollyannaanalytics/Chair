# Chair -- Android Social App

## Description
This is Pin-Yun's Project at AppWorks School.
Chair is an Android application born out of a background in social work and sociology. I believe that true friendship is about connecting with people who truly understand your concerns and struggles. With this in mind, I developed an innovative solution that leverages OpenAI's capabilities to help users find like-minded individuals who share their challenges. FriendConnect offers video chat functionality to facilitate these meaningful connections.

**AI-Based Matching**

| Description | Image |
|-------------|-------|
| After users create their profile information, Chair uses AI to categorize the concerns they input, prioritizing recommendations for users with similar worries through OpenAI | <img src="https://github.com/pollyannaanalytics/Chair/assets/114213570/4dd6e1b3-1427-4638-a810-e47c6be8a0ff"  width="240" height="520"> |
| Users can express their interest in other users by swiping left or right. If both individuals express mutual interest, they will be matched together | <img src="https://github.com/pollyannaanalytics/Chair/assets/114213570/7a7fbd86-48e8-4caa-8690-27cc8dcb2f58"  width="240" height="520"> |
| If users are matched together, a match page with canned responses is shown, allowing users to send messages to each other | <img src="https://github.com/pollyannaanalytics/Chair/assets/114213570/92fbfa61-d345-42a3-a140-eced5da47e31" width="240" height="520"> |
